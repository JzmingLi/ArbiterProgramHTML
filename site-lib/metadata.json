Hokmah\nWorld Institute of Scientific Exploration\nAn international organization formed by a coalition of nations dating back to the late 20th century. Their purpose is to investigate new inventions and scientific discoveries in order to establish countermeasures in the case of subsequent threats. WISE is the leading authority on science and medicine and has major influence in the lawmaking of states regarding new advancements, sometimes directly imposing regulations or restrictions. As the influence of corporations grew, WISE became susceptible to lobbying from companies whose sought to prevent their products and services from becoming obsolete due to new technologies. Following the discovery of the Radiance in the late 21st century, WISE asserted jurisdiction over all research and development efforts towards the Radiance and related technologies.Binah - Understanding / Concealment<a data-href=\"The Reclamation Doctrine\" href=\"factions/the-reclamation-doctrine.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Reclamation Doctrine</a> / Church of the Holy DoctrineA megachurch size cult that was the leading corporation in monetizing religion and faith. During the worldwide crisis of the Anthropocene they were among the greatest humanitarian efforts, providing shelter and aid. This gained them favour with the people, who turned away from their collapsing governments and infrastructure. Their massive following and reach makes them as powerful as a developed nation. Members are taught to have a supremacist mindset, treating non-believers as blasphemers. A caste system was formed in which pre-catastrophe followers were considered upper-class, with company executives being the highest. New followers were bound to servitude, owing their lives to their saviors. Following the discovery of the Radiance, they are harvesting radiance in the form of faith from their followers to produce alternative medicine and luxury goods. There are many churches all around the world but the headquarters is stationed in a church-owned independent state.Significant Roles Patriarch Cardinals Archbishops\nRadiance in the form of faith is transferred unrestricted through space directly to any object or target of worship. Those empowered can use abilities desired by those who supply the faith, such as healing, immortality, and smiting. While the patriarch and cardinals receive enough empowerment to live forever, only the archbishops are given enough to smite and heal on a large scale as Radiaccumulation makes them unstable. To keep them under control, subservience to the church is instilled at a young age. They can also emit radiance in a deceitful way that influences the perception and thoughts of others, such as making them appear younger in reflections or numbing chronic pain. Emissions can be captured in physical form as used to create crystal charms and incense, which the church sells to wealthy individuals and outsiders.It was found that faith can be harvested slowly through prayer, but technology developed allowed the implantation of neurotechnology that strengthened the faith and worship output of followers. These implants were applied during baptisms. but the death of devout followers can release large amounts of radiance at once. News of mysterious deaths began spreading but subsequently covered up as the actions of a great savior taking devout followers up into an afterlife paradise. This myth was taken advantage of by the church as those suffering were encouraged to become more devoted for the chance of an advance departure to the afterlife. As conflicts rose between factions, outsiders were interested in the methods of the church. In order to empower their enforcers and leaders, the church planned a mass harvest disguised as a Rapture in order to increase the faith of their followers quickly.In addition to faith, guilt can also be harvested as a form of Radiance. Confession booths in churches were converted to serve this new purpose. Priests were given a small fraction of the powers of Archbishops, allowing them to extract guilt from followers. In addition to the high presence of guilt resonant radiation in the booths, they were able to interfere with people's minds making them more susceptible to confessing their secrets. In addition, the extraction of guilt provides a sense of relief resembling weight being taken off one's conscience, a sensation followers would come back to experience again. Confession became part of culture allowing the Church to conduct mass surveillance on their citizens. Other states also formed or strengthened their partnerships with the Church to aid public security efforts through confessionals. The technology would soon spread to detective and intelligence agencies worldwide to aid with interrogations. An issue arose however, where guilt would be so overwhelming that suspects would falsely admit to crimes, starting an era of injustice.Chesed - Mercy, Benevolence / Suffocating Love\nAnodyne Incorporated\nAn international pharmaceutical company with many subsidiaries covering healthcare, insurance, security, and research.
